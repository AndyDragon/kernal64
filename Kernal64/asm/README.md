============
The K64 assembler was inspired mainly by KickAssembler project.

Here the main features:

 - IDE fully integrated with debugger
 - breakpoints
 - macros

In the asm directory you can find some examples: the code has been taken from KickAssembler's repository and other GitHub projects and adapted to K64 assembler syntax.
